Bugs:


Regressions:

- "empty trash" no longer works (infinite loop)
- TAB key in To:-Field inserts a TAB char
- serching for messages, then selecting a hit, then hitting the "Back" icon closes the window. It should switch back to the thread list.

Done:

- (Dirk) KVO notifications don't work with inverse many-to-many relationships (see test TestGIMessageGroup/testStatistics)
- (Axel) keyboard navigation in message tree no longer works
- (Axel) "space" in searches no longer works (-> maybe related to "go to next message" functionality)
- updates to the list of messages (fetching messages) do not result in thread-list reloads
- sometimes statistics display is not updated.
