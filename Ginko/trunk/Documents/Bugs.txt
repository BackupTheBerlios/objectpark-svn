Bugs:


Regressions:

- non-persistent "dupe in thread list" bug reappeared
- "empty trash" no longer works (infinite loop)

Done:

- (Dirk) KVO notifications don't work with inverse many-to-many relationships (see test TestGIMessageGroup/testStatistics)
- (Axel) keyboard navigation in message tree no longer works
- (Axel) "space" in searches no longer works (-> maybe related to "go to next message" functionality)
