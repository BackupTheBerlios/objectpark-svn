Bugs:

- having a real name with a comma in it, makes the SMTP-Server think there were multiple from addresses. Message is not sent, stays in queue, but sending makes woosh sound. :-/
- deleting message groups crashes the application
- "move to trash" for queued messages does not prevent sending - ouch! Check, if fixed!
- additional headers cannot be checked in Display preferences.
- deleting a message opened via fulltext search, results in an exception: 2006-05-01 09:34:02.500 Ginko[2100] *** -[GIThread copyWithZone:]: selector not recognized [self = 0x7414150], that code can never have worked.
- while extracting messages into a new thread, the old thread's date is not updated or this update is not noted (sort order not ok)
- password handling for SMTP is broken (once a wrong password was entered there is no way of correcting/changing the password)
- Cancelling Keychain access requests leads to ugly stream-error alert dialogs
- Messages with status "in send job" cannot be opened, nor are they sent - need to reset this at startup

Regressions:


Done:

- (Dirk) window positions are not persistent - implement a pool of (say 6) thread-list window positions to pick from on open
- (Dirk) OPSizingTextField did does not resize when a new selection is added by the formatter
- (Dirk) "empty trash" no longer works (infinite loop)
- (Dirk) serching for messages, then selecting a hit, then hitting the "Back" icon closes the window. It should switch back to the thread list.
- (Dirk) primitiveBoolValue no longer works (claims that the key is not valid)
- (Axel) TAB key in To:-Field inserts a TAB char
- (Dirk) KVO notifications don't work with inverse many-to-many relationships (see test TestGIMessageGroup/testStatistics)
- (Axel) keyboard navigation in message tree no longer works
- (Axel) "space" in searches no longer works (-> maybe related to "go to next message" functionality)
- (Axel) Replying sometime replies to the wrong message.
- (Axel) Validation of toolbar items in ThreadListController regression
- (Axel) sometimes statistics display is not updated.
- (Dirk) Editor's vertical scroll bar is too short (until window is resized)
- (Axel) fixed suboptimal rendering of search field in group toolbar
- (Axel) additional email addresses are not used to determine, if message is from self
- (Dirk) updates to the list of messages (fetching messages) do not result in thread-list reloads
- (Axel) while retrieving messages, sometimes only one account is used at first - the other accounts follow after the first has finished
- (Axel) Already reopened queued messages can be opened again (should not be possible)
- (Axel) Wenn ein Eintrag im "Put in message box"-Popup ausgewählt wird, darf der Haken daneben ruhig aktiviert werden  (reported by Jörg)
- (Axel) long lines without whitespaces does not wrap correctly (example: long url got a wrong space in it)
- (Axel) Beim Anlegen einer Mailbox wird das Popup zu "Put in message box" in der Filter-Pane nicht automatisch aktualisiert (reported by Jörg)
- (Axel) "general prefs" have no icon in release build (reported by Jörg)
