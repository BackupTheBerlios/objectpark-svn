Bugs:

- updates to the list of messages (fetching messages) do not result in thread-list reloads
- sometimes statistics display is not updated.
- while extracting messages into a new thread, the old thread's date is not updated or this update is not noted (sort order not ok)
- window positions are not persistent - implement a pool of (say 6) thread-list window positions to pick from on open
- while retrieving messages, sometimes only one account is used at first - the other accounts follow after the first has finished
- Editor's vertical scroll bar is too short (until window is resized)

Regressions:

- "empty trash" no longer works (infinite loop)
- serching for messages, then selecting a hit, then hitting the "Back" icon closes the window. It should switch back to the thread list.
- Replying sometime replies to the wrong message.

Done:

- (Dirk) - primitiveBoolValue no longer works (claims that the key is not valid)
- (Axel) - TAB key in To:-Field inserts a TAB char
- (Dirk) KVO notifications don't work with inverse many-to-many relationships (see test TestGIMessageGroup/testStatistics)
- (Axel) keyboard navigation in message tree no longer works
- (Axel) "space" in searches no longer works (-> maybe related to "go to next message" functionality)
